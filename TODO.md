## High Priority
- [x] Cross-platform clipboard support - Currently only works on Windows (clip.exe). Linux/Mac users can't use clipboard features.

- [x] Additional language translations - Only English exists. Adding more languages would help international players.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Dimension indicator in output - When copying coords, it doesn't show which dimension you're currently in (useful when sharing).

- [ ] Configurable coordinate format - No way to customize output (e.g., [100, 64, 200] vs X:100 Y:64 Z:200 vs current 100 64 200).

- [ ] Coordinate bookmarks/history - No way to save favorite locations or view recently copied coordinates.

- [ ] Distance calculator - Can't calculate distance between two coordinate sets or get direction/bearing.

- [ ] Additional keybinds - Only one keybind for basic copy. Could add keybinds for "copy converted to nether/overworld" or "copy with dimension name".

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Clickable chat coordinates - Make coordinate output clickable to re-copy or show on waypoint
- [ ] Waypoint mod integration - Integration with Xaero's Minimap, JourneyMap, etc.
- [ ] Decimal precision option - Currently always rounds to integers
- [ ] Copy to chat input - Paste coords into chat box instead of sending as message
- [ ] Config GUI improvements - Add keybind customization, format templates, etc.
