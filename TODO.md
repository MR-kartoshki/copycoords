## High Priority
- Nothing yet

## Medium Priority
- [x] Bookmark import/export (JSON) — allow sharing/backing up bookmarks across instances.

## Nice to Have
- [x] Copy to chat input — paste coords into chat input without sending (configurable).
- [x] Config GUI improvements — format template and live preview implemented (remaining: keybind editor)
- [x] Map-integration links — generate Dynmap/BlueMap or web-map links for coordinates.
